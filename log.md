# 100 Days Of Code - Log




### Day 39: March 06, 2018

**Working folder**: some online Java IDE

**Today's Progress**: Refreshed some algorithm knowledge and implemented them in Java: Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort


### Day 38: March 05, 2018

**Working folder**: online @codepen https://codepen.io/Dan312/pen/oEGBLa

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the design of the Share-button. Still a headache to get all elements to be where they are supposed to be. Generyla spoken, The design of the quote generator definitely is improvable, but for now, I want to close this challenge. Maybe I'll come back some day.


### Day 37: March 04, 2018

**Working folder**: online @codepen https://codepen.io/Dan312/pen/oEGBLa

**Today's Progress**: Did some minor changes to the API call of Twitter. Now it seems to be working properly (e.g. problems encountered when no author was empty). Started with some redesign.


### Day 36: March 03, 2018

**Working folder**: online @codepen https://codepen.io/Dan312/pen/oEGBLa

**Today's Progress**: Got the twitter API working, hell yeah! Sharing a tweet now possible: Check!


### Day 35: March 02, 2018

**Working folder**: online @codepen https://codepen.io/Dan312/pen/oEGBLa

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the dsign; the buttons for "next quote" and "last quote" were moving depending on the lines of the quote. Now they only move if thge quote has 4 or more lines (rarely the case).


### Day 34: March 01, 2018

**Working folder**: online @codepen https://codepen.io/Dan312/pen/oEGBLa

**Today's Progress**: Added the author. At the moment I have two arrays where quotes and authors are saved (I also have a back button). Neater solution would be to have an object. Maybe I will change it some day. But for now, I want to get this challenge done. Next step: Share buttons!


### Day 33: February 28, 2018

**Working folder**: online @codepen https://codepen.io/Dan312/pen/oEGBLa

**Today's Progress**: Implemented the API call to the codepen pen. It works hell yeah!


### Day 32: February 27, 2018

**Working folder**: online @codepen https://codepen.io/Dan312/pen/oEGBLa

**Today's Progress**: Ok. Wow. Found an API (api.forismatic.com/) where I receive an answer to my call. Next step: Implement it in the quote machine. Atm it is only on my playground pen.


### Day 31: February 26, 2018

**Working folder**: online @codepen https://codepen.io/Dan312/pen/oEGBLa

**Today's Progress**: Okay, know what? I'll use another source. Got some different sources and will try those out tomorrow. Did a lot of reading, only a bit coding.


### Day 30: February 25, 2018

**Working folder**: online @codepen https://codepen.io/Dan312/pen/oEGBLa

**Today's Progress**: Still working on the damn API. Jesus, gotta get it working!


### Day 29: February 24, 2018

**Working folder**: online @codepen https://codepen.io/Dan312/pen/oEGBLa

**Today's Progress**: API: I don't know why, but some getJSON won't work. Now started to try it out in a newly created project on GitHub with html, css and js files. Still not working after this one hour, which seemed to be like only a few minutes (lots of research).


### Day 28: February 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: No progress today, sick...


### Day 27: February 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: No progress today, sick...

### Day 25: February 20, 2018

**Working folder**: online @codepen https://codepen.io/Dan312/pen/oEGBLa

**Today's Progress**: API: Started a new pen as a playground to only get the API working. When I insert the link in a browser, I can see the object that is sent. Somehow, I can't get it working using json and ajax. Have to peek into the old exercised on FreeCodeCamp tomorrow.


### Day 24: February 19, 2018

**Working folder**: online @codepen https://codepen.io/Dan312/pen/oEGBLa

### Day 23: February 18, 2018

**Working folder**: online @codepen https://codepen.io/Dan312/pen/oEGBLa

**Today's Progress**: worked on the API to get some nice quotes. Not working yet, unfortunately I had to stop. Excited to continue tomorrow!


### Day 22: February 17, 2018

**Working folder**: local (backup-script) & online @codepen https://codepen.io/Dan312/pen/oEGBLa

**Today's Progress**: Local: completed the backup script. Now checking it out. Online: Finished the buttons.


### Day 21: February 16, 2018

**Working folder**: online @codepen https://codepen.io/Dan312/pen/oEGBLa

### Day 20: February 15, 2018

**Working folder**: online @codepen https://codepen.io/Dan312/pen/oEGBLa

**Today's Progress**: Got the JS started. Atm I have an array with quotes, on page load it displays the first one. Two buttons (next and previous) to iterate through quotes. Next: Add author and of course some API call!


### Day 19: February 14, 2018

**Working folder**: online @codepen https://codepen.io/Dan312/pen/oEGBLa

**Today's Progress**: Started with the Random Quote Machine. Tried out some stuff with html css to get a neat design. No JS coded yet.


### Day 18: February 13, 2018

**Working folder**: local on disk, backup script

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the backup script again. Since it is possible to delelte one folder, I decided to delete old backups (subfolders) as long as there is not enough space for another backup copy. It took quite a while to get some security mechanisms working otherwise the disk would probably eat itself up by deleting all folders (Didn't try that one out though. Not too clever.). Next step is to get it working with a new hard drive built into the PC -> Friday


### Day 17: February 12, 2018

**Working folder**: local on disk, backup script

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the backup script again. Checked out how to delete the oldes subfolder in a folder. This is now working (puts into bin)


### Day 16: February 11, 2018

**Working folder**: local on disk, backup script

**Today's Progress**: Polishing up the copy script and tried out some stuff. Want to implement some more security mechanisms. Started with a "copy not possible if drive is full." Going to continue with automatic deletion of oldest backup when drive is full.


### Day 15: February 10, 2018

**Working folder**: local on disk

**Today's Progress**: Started with an introduction to VBA, switched to PowerShell. First copy script exists

**Thoughts**: Wanted to get some insight into VBA programming to create a few scripts. Especially doing some backup-tasks is what I plan to do with it.
